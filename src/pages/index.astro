        Welcome to my blog! My name is Simona and I am now following the path of software engineering. The idea to start a blog was not mine, but my teacher's
        so I created this to document my journey. To be honest, I would never come 
        with this great idea to track my progress. I will try
        here mainly focus on the project, my progress, ideas, recommendations for good articles that I found for it
        and so on, and maybe in the future I'll dive into other topics as well :D
